        <h3>Q19:-What is the rule set?</h3>
        <p>Ans:-Each valid declaration block is preceded by one or more comma-separated selectors, which are conditions selecting some 
            elements of the page. A selector group and an associated declarations block, together, are called a ruleset, or often a rule.<br>
